\title{Training a neural network for features specified by user data.}
\usage{
train_ind(
  input,
  nodes = c(6, 3),
  nepoch = 20,
  plot = T,
  model = NULL,
  model_savefile = NA,
  validation_split = 0.1,
  test_split = 0.1,
  lev = c(0.5, 1)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{Either a list object with a single dataset (e.g. Shark_1_data) or a list object npeels long with a dataset for retrospective analysis (e.g. Shark_1_retro).}

\item{nodes}{A vector of 2 positions. Positive integers. There are few general rules for neural network design. However one rule of thumb is that the width of the first and second layer of the neural network. In general, the first layer should be smaller than the number of features (data types) in the user specified dataset. The second layer should be smaller than the first layer. Check for overparameterization in the fitting plots (e.g. a validation MAE that is substantially higher than the training MAE).}

\item{nepoch}{Positive integer. The number of iterations (passes of the back propagation algorithm) used in the training of the neural network. Should be sufficient that loss (or MAE) has stabilised.}

\item{plot}{Boolean. Should a simulated vs predicted plot / confusion matrix be presented for the independent testing dataset?}

\item{model}{A keras model. Optional. You may wish to keep training a partially trained model (needs to be compatible with shape of dataset).}

\item{model_savefile}{Character vector. Optional. A file location and name for saving the fitted keras model. Must have a .keras type. E.g. C:/temp/mymodel.keras.}

\item{validation_split}{Fraction. The proportion of the dataset that will be used for cross-validation as the neural network is training.}

\item{test_split}{Fraction. The proportion of the training dataset reserved as an independent testing dataset (those data of the simulated - predicted plot and confusion matrix).}

\item{lev}{A vector of 2 positions. The location of the breaks of the confusion matrix.}

\description{
A function that examines the user specified data, subsets the training dataset for those features (data types), standardizes the user data and trains a bespoke neural network indicator for the user specified data types.
