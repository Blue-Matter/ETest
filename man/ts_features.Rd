\title{Extract time-series features for Indicator 2 data inputs}
\usage{
ts_features(ts, lab = "", enp.mult = 0.2, rnd = 3, plot = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{ts}{A vector of positive real numbers, a data time series (e.g. 20 years of catch data)}

\item{lab}{Character string. The label (code) of the time series (e.g., C for catches, I for CPUE index, ML for mean length, MV for variability in mean length, FM for fraction mature).}

\item{enp.mult}{Positive fraction. Effective number of parameters multiplier. A value of 0.5 means a loess smoother will be fitted that has half as many parameters as data points. Larger numbers are more flexible models (less smoothing).}

\item{rnd}{Integer. Number of significant digits to plot.}

\item{plot}{Boolean. Should a plot be presented?}
